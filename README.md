# di_model
delayed inhibition model for V1 data
The code in this repository was used to fit a delayed inhibition (DI) model. We used the space time receptive field (measured via individual flashed bars) to predict the responses to a bar drifting across the screen. We performed cross validation and bootstrapping to confirm that the DI model outperforms the null hypothesis (H0) model (bar response predicted without delayed inhibition).
